### âœ¨ Project description

I decided to create my personal site from scratch, without using frameworks or over-the-top effects, in a form that can be directly interpreted by the browser.

### ðŸ™Œ Whatâ€™s easy to overlook but helps fully appreciate the project?

- a11y - fully operable using only a keyboard even during dynamic resize.
- Full RWD - The site adapts seamlessly to all resolutions - handles dynamic resizing including modals, navigation menus and tabIndex adjustments.
- No external libraries were used, it's all vanilla frontend stack - HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
