# Personal website

Website: https://hgm-portfolio.netlify.app

## âœ¨ Project description

I decided to create my personal site from scratch, without using frameworks or over-the-top effects, in a form that can be directly interpreted by the browser.

## ðŸ™Œ Whatâ€™s easy to overlook but helps fully appreciate the project?

a11y - fully operable using only a keyboard.
Full RWD - The site adapts seamlessly to all resolutions - handles dynamic resizing including navigation menus and tabIndex adjustments.
No external libraries were used, it's all vanilla frontend stack - HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
